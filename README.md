A Home Assistant integration for controlling OREI 8x8 HDMI matrix switches via their web interface.

## Features

- **8x8 Matrix Support**: Control all 8 outputs and 8 inputs
- **Real-time Status**: Monitor current input/output mappings
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup through Home Assistant's UI
- **Select Entities**: Use dropdown selectors to choose inputs for each output
- **Auto-discovery**: Automatically detects input and output names from the device

## Supported Devices

This integration is designed for OREI 8x8 HDMI matrix switches with web interface support. It has been tested with models that use the `/cgi-bin/instr` API endpoint.

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots menu and select "Custom repositories"
4. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/skroged/hass-orei-hdmi-matrix`
5. Select "Integration" as the category
6. Click "Add"
7. Find "OREI HDMI Matrix" in the integrations list and install it
8. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/skroged/hass-orei-hdmi-matrix/releases) page
2. Extract the `custom_components` folder to your Home Assistant configuration directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "OREI HDMI Matrix"
4. Enter your device details:
   - **Host/IP Address**: The IP address of your HDMI matrix (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
   - **Username**: Usually `Admin` (default)
   - **Password**: Usually `admin` (default)

## Usage

After configuration, you'll have 8 select entities created:

- `select.output_1_input` - Choose input for Output 1
- `select.output_2_input` - Choose input for Output 2
- ... and so on for all 8 outputs

Each select entity will show the available inputs (Input1, Input2, etc.) and allow you to change which input is connected to that output.

### Example Automation

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Switch Living Room TV to Gaming Console"
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.gaming_mode
      to: 'on'
    action:
      service: select.select_option
      target:
        entity_id: select.output_1_input
      data:
        option: "Input3"  # Assuming gaming console is on Input 3
```

### Example Script

```yaml
script:
  switch_to_movie_night:
    alias: "Movie Night Setup"
    sequence:
      - service: select.select_option
        target:
          entity_id: select.output_1_input  # Living Room TV
        data:
          option: "Input1"  # Media Player
      - service: select.select_option
        target:
          entity_id: select.output_2_input  # Bedroom TV
        data:
          option: "Input1"  # Media Player
```

## API Details

This integration communicates with the OREI HDMI matrix using HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi-bin/instr` endpoint:

- **Authentication**: `{"comhead":"login","user":"Admin","password":"admin"}`
- **Get Status**: `{"comhead":"get video status","language":0}`
- **Switch Input**: `{"comhead":"video switch","language":0,"source":[output,input]}`

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify the IP address is correct and the device is reachable
- Check that the web interface is accessible in a browser
- Ensure the username and password are correct (default: Admin/admin)

### Entity Not Updating

- Check the Home Assistant logs for any error messages
- Verify the device is responding to API calls
- Try restarting the integration

### Authentication Errors

- Some devices may have different default credentials
- Check the device's web interface for the correct username/password
- Some devices may require factory reset to restore default credentials
